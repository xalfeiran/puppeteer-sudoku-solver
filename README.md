# Sudoku Solver with Puppeteer

Welcome to the Sudoku Solver with Puppeteer repository! This Node.js project is designed to help new developers understand the usage and configuration of Puppeteer by providing a practical example of web scraping and automation. Feel free to fork this project to kickstart your own Puppeteer projects or to explore and contribute to the codebase.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node.js package manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xalfeiran/puppeteer-sudoku-solver.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd puppeteer-sudoku-solver
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### Usage
To run the Sudoku solver with Puppeteer, use the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```

This will initiate Puppeteer, navigate to a Sudoku website, read the current board, solve it, and fill the missing values in the website.

### Next steps
From this you can start working on your own approach, there are several sodoku sites out there to explore the powers of puppeteer.
